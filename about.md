# About the Roadrunner Balloon

1) 	The original Roadrunner balloon debuted at the 1973 Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta (AIBF).
In 1972, around the time of the founding of the Albuquerque Aerostat Ascension Association (AAAA)
Sid Cutter decided to have a balloon build that would symbolize Albuquerque’s version of the well known
Hare and Hound balloon competition.  
Raven, Int. Company build the 105,000 cubic foot envelope with two Warner Brother’s characters chasing
each other around the balloon.  The balloon was an instant hit and is fondly remembered by pilots 
and spectators of that era.  It went on to have an exciting career including a role in a 
Katherine Hepburn movie and the repair of an aerial cable in Hawaii.

2)	The story behind the replica balloon

Barbara Fricke, local Albuquerque pilot and AIBF board member was brainstorming for a special project
to enhance the celebration of the October 2022 event that would be the 50th Balloon Fiesta.
She hatched the idea of recreating one of the iconic balloons of the early Fiesta years. 

3)	The design of the new Coyote & Roadrunner

The design of the new balloon was chosen to be a faithful replication of the original with a few modern
updates.  The envelope volume was reduced from 105,000 cubic feet to 90,000 cubic feet by using the 
pattern for a Raven S57-A instead of the original S59-A, with the smaller design being a scaled down 
version of the larger one.  Modern light weight silicon coated nylon ripstop fabric was chosen instead
of the original’s heavier urethane coated ripstop nylon.  Both look very similar in flight, with the
lighter fabric being somewhat more translucent.  The original red pennants and the large black N-umbers
were faithfully replicated as was the 24 gore design, the star spangled skirt and the red parachute top.  
Each gore consisted of 16 vertically spaced panels for extra strength and ease of manufacture instead of 
the single full length gores of the original design. 

4)	The partners

When Barbara Fricke conceived the idea of building a new N1979R she was already an accomplished balloon builder, 
having previously sewed three experimental envelopes.  Encouraged by her partner, Peter Cuneo, they reached out 
to three other friends to assist in the project.  Bert and Joanie Padelt, owner/operators of the Best Aviation 
balloon shop were enlisted to produce the inlaid panels depicting the two cartoon characters.  
Finally, local pilot, Judy Nakamura was invited to become a joint owner of the balloon.

5)	The Naming of the balloon

The difficult task of naming the new balloon was being discussed one Friday evening around beers at a local
Albuquerque watering hole.  May mundane names were tossed out but none seemed to capture the unique and somewhat 
ethereal flavor of the project.  It was agreed that the name should capture the airborne aspect of two Quixotic 
characters battling it out in the sky.  Cathryn Campbell was the one who first suggested Spirit in the Sky, perhaps 
remembering the 1969 pop hit by Norman Greenbaum.  Just the right era, somewhat psychedelic and definitely offbeat.  
Some mutual heavy thinking, no doubt lubricated by the local brews, a slight modification produced the name ‘Spirits 
in the Sky’ to reflect the dual nature of the characters and perhaps to limit potential copyright issues. 

6)	The building of the balloon

Barbara would handle the sewing while Peter dealt with procurement of the xx colors of fabric, the three widths of
load tape.  Judy supplied Kevlar cables and carabiners from a dead envelope.  Bert and Joanie undertook the critical 
task of creating the colorful 40 foot tall characters.

10)	The mystery of the changing N#

Much research was undertaken to learn as much as possible about the original balloons.  Archives were searched for
photos of this balloon.  One still unsolved mysteries was uncovered during the research.  The original build sheet
graciously provided Alyssa Sullivan, the current curator of the Raven archives, clearly states that the N# is N1979R 
and some photos do show the envelope sporting that number is four foot high characters.  However other photos show it
instead wearing the N# N1951R.  The R is no mystery as all Raven envelopes of that era sported a final R as a reference
to Raven.  However, Judy uncovered the fact that 1951 was the year that Sid Cutter his first pilot rating.  
On the other hand 1979 does not seem to have any significance to either the balloon’s construction or to Sid’s career.  Is it possible that Sid arranged with the FAA to have the N# changed sometime after its original certification?
