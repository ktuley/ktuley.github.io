The design of the new Coyote & Roadrunner

The design of the new balloon was chosen to be a faithful replication of the original with a few modern
updates.  The envelope volume was reduced from 105,000 cubic feet to 90,000 cubic feet by using the 
pattern for a Raven S57-A instead of the original S59-A, with the smaller design being a scaled down 
version of the larger one.  Modern light weight silicon coated nylon ripstop fabric was chosen instead
of the original’s heavier urethane coated ripstop nylon.  Both look very similar in flight, with the
lighter fabric being somewhat more translucent.  The original red pennants and the large black N-numbers
were faithfully replicated as was the 24 gore design, the star spangled skirt and the red parachute top.  
Each gore consisted of 16 vertically spaced panels for extra strength and ease of manufacture instead of 
the single full length gores of the original design.
